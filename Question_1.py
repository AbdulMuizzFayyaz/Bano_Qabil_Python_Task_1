# Question No. 1:
# Declare and initialize two variables, num1 and num2, with integer values. Calculate and print their sum.

# First we declare two variables : num1 and num2 and use input function along with int function.
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number :"))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number :"))

# Now we declare a variable for sum.
sum = num1+num2 

# Now we use print function to get the output.
print("The Sum of two numbers is :",sum)
