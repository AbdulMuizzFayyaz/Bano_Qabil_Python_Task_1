#Question No. 10:
#Create a tuple, days_of_week, with the names of the days. Access and print the third day of the week.

#First we declare a variable "days_of_week" and assign it a tuple.
days_of_week = ('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday')

#Now we declare a variable which will be responsible for accessing third day of the week.
third_day = days_of_week[2]

#Now we print both our tuple and the third day from the tuple.
print("The tuple of days of the week is :",days_of_week)
print("The third day of the week in the tuple is :",third_day)
