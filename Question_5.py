#Question No. 5:
# Declare a variable, price, with a floating-point value. Convert it to an integer and print both the original and converted values.

#First we declare the variable "price" with a floating-point value and print it using print function.
price = 280.10
print ("The price of usd into pkr is :",price)

print ("The price of usd into pkr is :",int(price))
